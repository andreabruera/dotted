pukwac	Education and Skills ( Panel 4 ) Chairman: Everybody agrees this is the absolute key to productivity both nationally and internationally , and it is the area where Britain clearly needs to compete. Sir Terry Leahy: Well , good afternoon and obviously today 's conference covers a range of issues that are critically important to the future of Britain. Looking at the programme , enterprise , innovation , trade , liberalisation , nurturing entrepreneurs , but central to them all is people , and central to that is the ability of our people and the skills that they 're taught. Obviously in a global market we need to evaluate our skills against those of other countries. That comparison is sometimes frightening. I 've just returned from a trip to India , visiting our new service centre in Bangalore , and in that one service centre , we employ something like 800 science graduates. Similarly four years ago , at Imperial College in the UK , there were just 60 Chinese undergraduates in chemistry and engineering , and I 'm told that this year there will be 1,000 Chinese undergraduates there. Now , there 's a lot in the papers at the moment , even this morning , about the problems of education and training , and we clearly face some big challenges. But we also need to remember that discussions like this one have their limits. Our sense of priorities and answers are shaped by our own experience and prejudices , and the future of course always turns out differently. I 'm sure everybody are at least aware of , if they do n't actually remember , Harold Wilson 's famous speech 40 years ago , when he spoke , that the country ' was going to be forged in the white heat of a new scientist revolution , ' and that phrase sparked a lot of public imagination at the time. In fact the vision turned out to be pretty side of the mark. Its emphasis on central planning and state driven technology and government-run enterprises proved to be the wrong prescription , and in fact today when people think about that famous speech , they think it was of a failed vision of the future. It 's interesting though , if you actually [SEP] read the speech [SEP] , buried away in there was a passage that attracted no publicity but remains as fresh and relevant today as it should have been back in 1962. What he said was that for his vision of Britain to succeed , we needed to unlock all the latent and undeveloped energies and skills of our people. Maybe it was that that should have had the priority at the time rather than the state controlled technology companies. So unlocking those skills is always vital economically , but of course it 's much more than just economics. I know from my own experience in Tesco , we 've taken 3,000 people off the long-term unemployed and we 've trained them , given them special training in our business , and it 's not just the jobs we 've given them , of course , at the end of it , it 's their self-esteem , it 's the respect of their families and their neighbours , and it 's difficult to put a price on that. I think the challenge for us is clear. We 've got some great success stories in Britain , but 17 million of our adults have below Level 1 numeracy , and 6 million have below Level 1 literacy , but even this is only part of the picture. It 's not just about reading and writing , it 's about equipping people with the skills businesses need today , the ability to give good service , the ability to communicate , to lead teams , to get the best out of each other and out of technology , skills that are difficult to impart but are at the heart of every successful business. One thing that I 've learnt from our business as it 's become international in Asia and in Europe is that in fact no country thinks they 've got all the answers to education and training , so there is n't a blueprint that we can import. We 're going to have to work this out for ourselves , and we 're lucky to have a very strong panel here hopefully to make a small contribution to that discussion. So if we begin the discussion , gentlemen , I suppose it 's got to start with the widely acknowledged gap in basic skills. We 've got a very poor record in the UK on basic skills. Steve , I mean , what do you think has gone wrong? Your career is in education , when 17 million adults are unable to mark down prices in a sale , and 6 million ca n't produce a document from a standard template. NN Steve Sinnott: Well , I thought it was interesting , Terry , that you started off by , or contained within what I think was a fascinating introduction , some of the considerations from Harold Wilson. I campaigned for Harold Wilson in the 60's. We both know that particular area of the world and it 's not true that I gave you elocution lessons , by the way , Terry. But what was contained within the vision of Harold Wilson there was an expansion of opportunities for youngsters. I think that was a good speech , and if we look over a long period , the whole of the post-war period was an interesting development of opportunities , of an expansion of people being involved in education , and of I think tremendous number of success stories , certainly during the 60's and the 70's. Many of those improvements are identified in my view with the improvements in our education system with comprehensive education. But we have had a persistent problem in the English education system , partly British but mostly the English part of our education system , and that 's tackling this issue of those from the most challenging , the most disadvantaged backgrounds , them not doing as well in education as they should. Can I start with some good news? The good news is that the situation is changing , and if we take the last few years , the area that has improved most in our education world is the area that is served by the youngsters who go to schools which have the most free school meals. The biggest improvements in literacy and numeracy , and they 're quite staggering , are in the area where we have the most challenging backgrounds. Now , we want to extend that , and there 'll be no teacher , no teacher who will be satisfied until we really do make some improvements here. back to top Sir Terry Leahy : NN The rates of progress is in the toughest areas , is it ?
