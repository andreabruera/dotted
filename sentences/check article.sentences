was told that her bellybutton was God ' s fingerprint , from God poking her to make sure she was done , like the Pillsbury dough boy , when she was born The things grown ups tell kids to save themselves lengthy explainations shakes head Yeah I know it is after 4 in the morning I ended up crashing early sooooo I am awake early sipping coffee with chicory and thinking Dangerous that thinking it can get you in trouble with all sorts of folks including the feds , who want us to be placid sheep grazing acceptingly on the bits of misinformation they feed us Oh well not going there at the moment not awake enough to get THAT agitated and waste emotions on thoughts of the loss of our freedoms especially the freedom of speech Tho I have been considering other things , sort of the flotsam and jetsom of the fringes of my thoughts , some of you in the last few weeks have decided to label me , interesting , awesome , and special to mention a few Unfortunately maybe good thing for my head room You have not convinced me Then I live with myself 24 7 I will concede I am NOT boring , hopefully Even my Mom said I was VERY different from the rest of the world I really and truly tho am not sure how the rest of the world thinks I just know how I think and MY REALITY I also know I am blessed beyond discription and have inherited an awesome legacy I have not been and most likely will not be blessed with physical off spring but I have been granted a beaucoups of love to share with my kids I work with My gifts and talents I came by the old fashioned way I inherited them Geeez folks you have no idea of the wonderful legacy I am descended from Some of you have heard me say I come from a long line of strong willed and determined women sounds better than bossy and stubborn I also spring from a treasure trove of truly gifted story tellers , writers and artists , preachers , teachers , and farmers who had to work hard to survive and thought their creative gifts were just a hobby for entertainment of the children sides her drawing talent you should have seen the amazing paper doll and design chains my grandmother entertained us with With no children I am physically responsible for my tom cat thinks he owns ME so guess he technically does not count impish grin and no spousal unit as a friend of mine says , BTW have several friends promising to beat me over the head with a frying pan till I come to my senses if I even consider marriage again I seem at the moment to be the one to share this awesome legacy with the world and attempt to make a living with it I am currently in the right place and the right time the creative community here is bursting at the scenes and so inspiring and encouraging Ya ' ll have no clue how much you mean to me in return Please understand tho in coming months I am going to have to hustle my talents to get the bills paid and if I turn down your request for a volunteer benefit please understand I got my personal quota of those booked up thru June Yeah I know it is nearly 5 am and I am sure and certain my mental meanderings are getting a bit much even for me so if you read this far , THANKS and have a GREAT weekend and HAVE FUN Harmony and

Gras I am posting the a Mardi Gras story below please go to the site and vote for it as well http news yahoo com s ap 20060226 ap on re us katrina six months later Despite Mardi Gras , New Orleans Struggling Yes I am heading to the parades and a party afterwards I am Louisiana thru and thru tho I do not NOT live in NOLA I do live in Louisiana I do not FORGET , I remember as we all do in our unique way here NONE of us forget we remember in our style we celebrate within the destruction We NEVER forgot and we honor our brothers and sisters , tears and joy Laissez les Bon Temps Rouler Let the Good Times Roll Louisiana Laissez faire Katrina and Rita danced twistingly thru Louisiana loving us too much Scattering us like broken beads thrown into the heart of hurricanes Louisiana Laissez faire everywhere Leaving bits of Louisiana lingering among the states , strung together with Cajun spicy diversity strengthened in adversity Louisiana Laissez faire everywhere Take care and let the good times roll The beguiling Louisianan might capture your soul in amid jazzy blends with Tabasco soaking in Louisiana Laissez faire everywhere Joanna Ballard Despite Mardi Gras , New Orleans Struggling By RUKMINI CALLIMACHI , Associated Press Writer Sat Feb 25 , 10 47 PM ET NEW ORLEANS They re throwing Mardi Gras beads again JJ so many strands , they re landing in tree branches and getting snagged on the trellised balconies of the French Quarter You ll find them adorning the arms of Spanish statues Tourists are wearing them , but these days so are contractors and the National Guard It s hard to walk on Bourbon Street without stepping on them You re likely to crunch them underfoot , long necklaces of plastic pearls brightening the asphalt At the corner of Bourbon and St Peter , Pat O Brien s is once again serving its syrupy , yet potent Hurricane cocktail At Tropical Isle , you can get an equally potent Hand Grenade in a tall , plastic go cup But walk to the end of Bourbon Street , take a left on Esplanade Avenue , a right on Rampart Street and head east At first , the debris comes in bits A small pile of siding A rusted box spring One taped up refrigerator At first , you find them in neat piles , in the front yard or outside on the curb There s still a semblance of order But keep going It gets worse You pass an elegant sofa , the kind you might imagine a grand dame reclining in , sipping her mint julep It is lodged in the middle of an intersection A few miles farther , the innards of rotting houses spill out on both sides of the road Six months have passed since Katrina ravaged this city For a half a year , its people have counted the dead officially , 1,080 in Louisiana and 231 in Mississippi and struggled mightily to keep their city among the living A slimmed down Mardi Gras is testament to their success a tour of the devastation that remains is testament to how far they have to go Hurricane Katrina created an estimated 60 3 million cubic yards of debris in Louisiana , 25 times as much as the ruins of the World Trade Center and enough to fill the Superdome more than 13 times Of that , only 32 million cubic yards NN a bit more than half NN has been removed Meanwhile , there are just under 2,000 people listed as missing Some are not missing at all NN they turned up , but their families never notified authorities Hundreds of others , though , were very likely washed into the Gulf of Mexico or swept into Lake Pontchartrain or alligator infested swamps , according to Dr Louis Cataldie , Louisiana s medical examiner Still more may be buried in the rubble At a hurricane morgue near Baton Rouge , 86 bodies remain unidentified State officials are trying to reach relatives for another 74 who ve been identified but have no place to go Mayor Ray Nagin says a comparison to New York City should be a favorable one Let me remind you that after 9 11 in New York , it took them six to eight months to get out of the fog of what happened to them And to date , there s still a big hole in the ground So when I look at everything that s going on , I think we re right on schedule , he said Indeed , in the French Quarter and on St Charles Avenue , on Magazine Street and in the plantation style mansions of Uptown , life has moved on , though protective blue tarps that serve as roofs for many are a constant reminder of the work left to be done In the Quarter , uber chef Paul Prudhomme is blackening his signature redfish again Bourbon House is shucking oysters , and Antoine s , the 166 year old dining icon , is dishing up plates of Pompano Pontchartrain with slices of tart lemon Yet even here , Katrina has left her mark All three restaurants are short handed Antoine s , which lost its 200,000 wine collection in the storm , is shifting its wine list away from French staples , embracing New World wines instead And look closely at the brass band playing outside Prudhomme s K Paul s Louisiana Kitchen The golden sheen on the tuba is gone , lost in the deluge at the musician s house But in the flood zone , the destruction is not so subtle Leave the French Quarter on Rampart and head east , toward the devastated Ninth and Lower Ninth wards and East New Orleans All around are the carcasses of flooded houses Katrina laid waste to more than 215,000 homes Many are abandoned , their doors wide open Only an estimated 189,000 of the city s roughly 500,000 pre Katrina residents have returned For now , the city is overwhelmingly whiter and more affluent than it was before Affordable housing is scarce , and FEMA has only filled 48,158 of the 90,000 trailer requests it s received from displaced families in Louisiana , leaving many to wait out their existence in places like Atlanta , Houston and Little Rock With only 20 of 128 public schools now open , parents who can t afford to send their children to private schools have no choice but to live elsewhere Children who have returned must wade through wreckage to get to school You never really get used to it , said 18 year old Mark Buchert , a senior at Brother Martin , an all boys Catholic high school in the devastated Gentilly neighborhood The destruction gets worse Keep driving as Rampart turns into St Claude Avenue and you ll go six miles before you pass a working traffic light Broken signals swing from their poles like men hanging from gallows Others blink red Elsewhere , they lie on their side in intersections , blinking yellow Even with a diminished population , traffic at rush hour is heavy Many people living elsewhere temporarily return to the city each day to work at their jobs or to work on their homes , so the main arteries in and out of town are clogged Add to the mix the large trucks used for the cleanup , and a commute from suburban New Orleans to the central business district that took 10 minutes before the storm can take 45 minutes now At night , the darkness is pervasive Six months after the storm made landfall Aug 29 , a little over a third of the structures in the city have electricity Even fewer have hot water or cooking gas Past the Industrial Canal , even farther east , is the cement slab upon which Carolyn Berryhill s house used to sit In the field of rubble,all that remains of her neighborhood in the Lower Ninth Ward , the 60 year old Miss Carolyn recognizes the pieces of her house by their signature green color One piece of her home landed at the base of a nearby pecan tree , the same tree whose branches cradled Berryhill for 12 hours after a gush of water NN the result of a broken levee NN rushed into her parlor and blew apart her home like a bomb She somehow floated to the tree and waved madly at rescuers in helicopters until they finally saw her and plucked her to safety In what used to be Berryhill s backyard , an unchipped porcelain plate is half filled with a meal of mud The earth is still spongy , as if it hasn t fully swallowed the storm s waters In it , a golden doorknob is embedded as if it s about to open a door to the underworld A lot of people , they talk about coming back and rebuild , she said Rebuild what What can you rebuild out of this What can you salvage out of this A half block away , she finds what she thinks might be her stove On a parallel street , 71 year old Gloria Jordan warns that if you walk much farther , you ll see things I pray to God you never see again It s a street where three people drowned in their attics , including a 12 year old girl Their bodies were found months later I have no appetite It s hard to eat these days , says Jordan , frail like a leaf She joins her husband , Clarence , on what used to be their porch , now nothing but a concrete foundation Jordan s eyes gladden as she remembers how each morning she used to sip her coffee in a rocking chair and look out across her small garden of flowers She wishes she could remember their names For now , she and Clarence are living with their daughter in White Castle , 73 miles west of New Orleans Baby , I had a beautiful home , said Jordan , who owned her house for 49 years It s hard when you lived on your own for so many years and just like you pop your finger , or in the twinkling of an eye , you re homeless Her property is exactly the way the hurricane left it Her husband s suits were blown into a neighbor s yard , still on hangers His truck is on its side Still waiting for her insurance check , she hasn t even started clearing the debris Those who are rebuilding are largely the ones who can front the costs of repairs Contractor Darren Schmolke returned alone to his destroyed home after losing his wife in a car wreck during their evacuation to Florida National Guard troops had roped off the posh Lakeview neighborhood where he raised his family Each time they chased him away , he would pretend to leave , walking instead around the block and returning through the back door He worked nonstop to reassemble his house , a two story colossus in granite , marble and brick His neighborhood , where homes had water up to their roofs , is one of many that are now in limbo , waiting for government officials to determine whether residents can rebuild After I lost my wife , I couldn t sit around and wait , Schmolke said I had to do something to get some control back over my life Businesses that are rebuilding are running into another problem NN a shortage of workers Help Wanted and Now Hiring signs are everywhere They re in the windows of unpretentious delis as well as cultural landmarks like Cafe du Monde , the 144 year old institution that for generations has served New Orleanians its iconic beignets Call any New Orleans Domino s and before you can order a pizza , you ll first be asked to listen to a 20 second message recruiting new drivers The problem is more basic than ` where are the people The problem is the people don t have anywhere to live , said Loren Scott , a professor emeritus of economics at Louisiana State University Corporations are housing workers in barge dorms , cruise ships , warehouses and converted train cars Those that can afford to do so are buying trailers for their employees , as Paul Prudhomme did for everyone from his chief operating officer to his line cooks Susan Rudolph , a waitress at Cafe du Monde , slept in her truck when she first returned to the city NN her husband in the driver s seat , she in the passenger seat , and all they own packed tightly behind them Now , she begins her day at dawn inside her FEMA funded motel room , scouring the classifieds for an affordable apartment With one bedrooms going for 1,500 and with landlords asking for first and last month s rent plus a security deposit , getting into an apartment is a 4,500 investment NN a tall order for someone waiting tables After a morning spent looking , she puts on a brave face and her white Cafe du Monde cap and smiles sweetly as she serves the hot and sticky beignets to chattering visitors New Orleans has always been a tourist area , so we smile like clowns , Rudolph said I hope one day there won t be one tear in our eye Harmony and Peace my brothers and sisters 14/02/2006 In case you ve forgotten
