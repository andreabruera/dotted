pukwac	How will these forces for change [SEP] affect the market [SEP] for financial services provided to SMEs ?
pukwac	A personal perspective on branding and globalisation Bernard Arnault : JJ Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen. I think I could have continued on creativity but I will say a few words about globalisation and branding from my perspective. Today we are told the world is getting smaller : global capital flows , the internet , cable media and international air travel have shrunk time and space , but all too frequently modern man is ignoring and forgetting the lessons of history , I think. In truth we have been here before. Globalisation is not a peculiar product of the late 20th century. I think it is a process through which global economies and societies periodically move. One of the greatest errors of globalisation swept the world during the late 18th century. The demands of international warfare as well as a commercial energy of public trading companies such as the English , French and Dutch East India Companies accelerated political , economic and cultural exchange. Events in Calcutta , Boston or Indo-China directly [SEP] affected the markets [SEP] in Amsterdam , Paris and London. The old mercantilist model of protectionism was breaking down. The celebrated Scottish economist Adam Smith quite rightly argued in the wealth of nations that protectionism was no route to raising living standards , rather free commerce was a path to prosperity as well as peace between nations. This remains valid today , as we face another era of globalisation. We must embrace that with enthusiasm to inspire the broader progress of mankind , and with it , then as now , cultural respect , public education , free trade and an ethic of global citizenship. As a citizen of France myself , and a businessman of the world , my perspective is inevitably bifocal , and I have to admit that the caricature of France as a nation of inveterate protectionists resolutely set against globalisation is widely believed. This is very wide of the mark. When it comes to the market in luxury goods , the market in which my company LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton operates , France is part of a single European market of 25 countries , who external tariff barriers are generally low , and since these tariffs are set at a European level , they are by definition no higher for France than they are for Britain , Germany , or for that matter , ultra free market of Estonia. National income statistics bear witness to this openness. Imports account for nearly a quarter of the French economy , a slightly higher share than in Britain , and over twice as much as in the United States. It might surprise some people to know that the French are as keen on e-bay , Amazon and Google as everyone else. In total the stock of foreign direct investment in France comes to nearly $ 600 billion , less than in Britain but not by much , and I think it has got to be good news that many large French companies are headed by executives who are not themselves French : Carlos Ghosn , for instance , at Renault , while one of our leading politicians and most likely the next president is the son of a Hungarian immigrant , and for my own part , I successfully brought in Mark Jacobs , an American , as a chief designer at Louis Vuitton , and John Galliano , a British citizen , to revitalise Christian Dior. In short , although many French politicians and French people may , just may , be instinctively sceptical of globalisation , and although the French state is more interventionist than most , in practice France , like its European counterparts , is open for business with the rest of the world. In fact France could even be considered as being part of the biggest beneficiaries of globalisation. France is the fifth biggest exporter of goods in the world , and the fourth biggest exporter of commercial services , and while Britain is widely considered a success story of globalisation , and rightly so , France , with a similar size population and economy , actually exports more than Britain does. The number of big globally successful companies and brands that France boasts is truly remarkable : Hachette Filipacchi , the world 's biggest magazine publishers ; in retailing , Carrefour is number two only to Walmart ; in pharmaceuticals , Sanofi-Aventis is a world number three ; Publicis is the world 's fourth biggest advertising agency ; Accord is the largest hotel group in Europe , and the world 's fourth largest. I could go on , Total in oil , Axa in insurance , BNP-Paribas and Socit Gnrale in banking. To tell you the truth , it pleases me a great deal that the French companies are so successful within the global market-place , and I am particularly proud that LVMH has succeeded in becoming the world 's leading luxury goods producer , and yet all of us at LVMH know that there can be no grounds for complacency. The challenge of global competition is real and increasing. If we are to continue to prosper , we must remain one step ahead of competition. One of the biggest fears about globalisation for the citizens of today is that it is a headlong race to lower living standards. Their theory goes that our advanced economies with their higher wages and standards cannot hope to win , yet is not this the exact opposite of what Adam Smith taught us some 200 year ago? In fact globalisation I think is a race to the top , where we can only prosper by continually raising our game. To put it bluntly , China does not want to drag us down to where it is now. I think it wants to catch up with us and maybe at one point overtake us. We should welcome the challenge , not only because it can spur us on to greater things , but also because the rising prosperity of China and other developing countries provides us with exciting new opportunities. LVHM success is emblematic I think of this race to the top. We are continually improving our products and forever reinventing ourselves. We have achieved and will maintain , I hope , our leading position at the top of the value chain only thanks to the creativity of our designers , the quality of our products , the skill of our management teams , and the savoir-faire applied to marketing our brands. It is only because our products are of exceptionally high quality that they can command a premium price in an increasingly competitive global market , and that exceptionally high quality in turn is dependent on having an extremely skilled workforce , which is why we still make most of our products here in Europe and why our workforce continues to deserve premium wages. As long as we continue to raise our game and as long as our workforce remains the best in the world , we have nothing to fear and much to gain from global competition. LVMH already has 15,000 boutiques in 63 countries , we employ 60,000 people at more than 50 brands. Our sales last year totalled E12 billion. What 's more , our aim is to double the size and profitability , if we can , over the next five years , because we have taken time to invest for the long term in the brands and the markets. Interestingly , China accounts for an increasing share of our sales. We now have already 13 stores in China for our Louis Vuitton brand alone. Our biggest store in the Asia-Pacific region meanwhile is in Shanghai , and we expect our new flagship in Paris , on the Champs Elyses to be a hit with the growing number of Chinese tourists. This example illustrates a simple truth : the Chinese spend the profits that they earn selling us T-shirts and televisions and other things on Western products , so they make us better off twice over. First , I think , by cutting the cost of our products , of our imports , second by increasing the demand for exports we produce , and dare I say it , the terms of trade are pretty favourable in our direction. You have to sell a great deal of cheap T-shirts in order to be able to afford some Louis Vuitton luggage .
